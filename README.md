# WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN?

- It is a digital ledger (record keeping book) that records transactions across many computers in a secure and decentralized manner.
- It maintains data integrity and security by linking each new block to the previous one in a tamper resistant chain

Ethereum: Are smart contracts decentralized agreements?
Main difference between the eth and bitcoin protocol is the smart contracts. eth brought it and bitcoin doesn't have it.

#### Chain-link:

The Oracle Problem: smart contract agreements needing real world data

- on chain plus off chain contracts (hybrid)

### THE PURPOSE AND VALUE OF SMART CONTRACTS

Basic First Step: What is a smart contract.

- A smart contract is an agreement, contract, or a set of instructions that is deployed on a decentralized blockchain.
- The terms of a smart contract cannot be altered once deployed.
- Unbreakable promises.

#### What have smart contracts done?

1. DeFi - Decentralized Finance: Gives users the ability to engage with finance and markets without having to go through a centralized intermediary.
2. DAOs - Decentralized Autonomous Organizations - groups that are governed completely decentralized? Groups? Voting and governance technology is completely decentralized.
3. NFTs - Non Fungible Tokens (Digital R or a Unique Asset)

#### INTRODUCTION TO GAS

- YOU HAVE TO PAY A TRANSACTION FEE FOR EACH TRANSACTION MADE ON THE BLOCKCHAIN
- Nodes as a minor or validator get paid for processing transactions.
- Total amount of gas used = gas used \* gas price
- The more people are sending a transaction at the same time, the more expensive it'll be.
